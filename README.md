# GodotMechanicsWithJustin
This is a repository of the Unity project I'll be using for the Wednesday Mechanics with Godot series I'm streaming on Twitch.tv

First Update is the 2d Jump mechanic. We wanted a jump that felt properly weighty but also was fully configurable.

I make no guarantee on code quality but I will try to keep these looking and working well.
